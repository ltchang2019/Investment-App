AUTO INVEST
- App that automatically invests in and sells stocks with transferred funds using CAN SLIM model
- Could query data from IBD?
- Create stock lists based on minimum rating and data standards
- Different program to track charts of stocks and detect buy points and patterns
- take profits as percentage of profits from each transaction
- Like Acorns on steroids
- What would large scale economic impacts be if an app like this became mainstream?*

Implementation Ideas:
S1
- Develop prototype which queries data from IBD (lot like Tesla creating Roadster prototype from Lotus lol)
- Query information from IBD 50 List
    - Get stock symbols from <tr> sets
    - Search ChartAnalysis class for buy point info (use keywords and order?)
- Once stock reaches described buy point or is within 5% of buy point (after buy point is reached), buy stock automatically
- Follow 8% Rule if stock drops under buy price
- Could use ChartAnalysis again for selling or could figure something else out

S2
- Automatically download IBD 50 in excel sheet daily using export url
- Use javascript and Jquery to traverse top 50 stocks list in excel online
- Figure out how to access stock charts and read patterns of each IBD 50 stock using code
    - start with flat base
    - Then make maybe move to cup with handle

S3
- Focus on tracking the price of one stock first
- Donâ€™t worry about entering IBD 50 List just try to do pattern detection given the symbol of stock

S4 (7/15/19):
- Now you can access IBD 25 and stocks hitting new highs
- Most of the IBD 25 are around 52 week highs anyways so search for relative highs within past 4-6 weeks
- after finding relative high focus on checking for correction no more than 15% and set buy point to relative high + 10 cents

S5:
- GET CURRENT PROGRAM TO SEND YOU NOTIFICATIONS FOR NEW HIGHS; YOU MAKE BUY DECISIONS STILL AND TEST OVER NEXT FEW MONTHS TO SEE IF PROJECT IS JUSTIFIED BY RETURNS

S6:
- add new database table for checking what new highs over 10 cents have already been reported (so you don't keep sending messages for same stock)
