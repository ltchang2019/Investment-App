Additions Needing to Be Made:
- Major Changes:
  - adding relative highs into PHP database and adding in buy point 10 cents above relative high (compare intraday highs to that value)
  - Offsetting actual trade notification to a day after actual breakout day; exclude current day from relative high calculations, then check for new high at end of day; signal for program to check new high stock's closing volume at end of day (+40% over 50 MA volume); then if all other conditions are fulfilled (correction %, duration, etc) then send notification to buy for next morning
- Minor Technical Changes:
  - detecting whether or not you are reaching 4+ stage base
  - add indicator for how tight prices are closing to check tightness of overall pattern (maybe create formula to indicate tightness of base based on differences in consecutive closing prices?)

Additions To Be Made With Access to College Resources:
- accessing relative intraday volume (maybe asking professors or companies about getting access to intraday data online?)

General Notes:
- seems that almost every pattern is some variation of a flat base... cup handles, high tight flags, square boxes, double bottoms, etc...
- FFTY fund far outperformed S&P 500; 104% return vs 50% return between bull period of 2016 to 2018; 38% vs 25% return on 2019 bull market
- Checklist of Required Characteristics:
  - price breakout
  - high volume breakout
  - tight pattern (especially in base portion)
  - limited correction
  - prior +30% price growth (already given in IBD 50?)
  - if past three weeks had tight closing prices and small high low ranges, can count as 3 weeks tight instead of flat base

Overview:
- Bull Market:
  - detect flat base breakouts
  - look for distribution days and sell off at 4
- Downturn:
  - check for accumulation days and follow through days
  - take quarter position upon follow through day buying strong stocks with minimal declines during correction AND breaking out of flat bases
  - once market increases by certain percentage, invest rest in new stocks breaking out of bases or back into successful initial investments

MAIN FOCUS NOW IS DETECTING STOCKS WITHIN BUY RANGE THAT HAVE ALREADY BROKEN OUT
